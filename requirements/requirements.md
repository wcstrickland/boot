### Problems

- scope creep
    - defend against it by managing expectations and clearly defining requirements
- finding things too late creates exponential increase


### Iron triangle

- managing expectations means the client is only able to control 2 legs of the triangle



### Scrum

- Team
    - Scrum master
    - product owner: sometimes the client business analyst

- Product backlog
    - list of user stories

- Sprint backlog
    - iteration set length
    - sprint planning meeting
    - pull things from the product backlog to work on

- Stand-up  
    - report blocking problems and progress
    - what did I do
    - what will I do
    - what is in my way
    - what do I need

- Retrospective
    - good
    - bad
    - ugly
    - improvements
    - dev team and master

- Sprint Review
    - product owner is there
    - client perspective
    - demos
    - deliverables


## Requirements

- determined via meetings with clients
- clarified over time
- attending meeting
    - client
    - product owner
    - tech lead
    - ideal to have as much of the team as possible
